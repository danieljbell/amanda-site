            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>With 11 years of leadership experience in healthcare, operations management, and the talent acquisition
              industry, I have obtained a valuable blend of professional knowledge to contribute to the workplace. I am
              knowledgeable in labor laws and EEOC and OFCCP compliance while managing a diverse population of
              professionals at many levels. I enjoy helping other professionals succeed in their career by endorsing the
              following truth: "Certain skills sets can be transferable across industries, securing the right fit for
              the
              right position." As a positive and visionary leader, I influence others to explore innovative solutions to
              overcome operational and talent asset barriers, resulting in desirable outcomes and a positive team
              culture.
